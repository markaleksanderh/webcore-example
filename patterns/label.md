# Label

A label is used as an indicator to give the user extra context about the content.

### When to use

- A label should be used to show where a piece of content sists within the contents lifecycle, e.g. if a piece of content is in progress or due to expire.
- A label should be used to indicate there's something special about the content, e.g. featured, exclusive.
- To highlight recency, e.g. updated, breaking news.
- To show a piece of content is part of a series or collection, e.g. boxset.
